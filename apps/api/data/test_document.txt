This is a sample document for testing the document upload functionality.

Atlas RAG is a retrieval augmented generation platform that allows users to chat with documents using vector similarity search.

The system works by:
1. Breaking documents into chunks
2. Creating vector embeddings for each chunk
3. Storing chunks in a vector database
4. Retrieving relevant chunks based on user queries
5. Using retrieved chunks as context for AI responses

This document contains multiple sentences to ensure proper chunking and embedding generation.

It should be split into several chunks for testing the chunking functionality.

The upload endpoint should be able to process this text and store it in the database successfully.

End of test document.
